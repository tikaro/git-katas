# Think Company Git Katas

## Quick Start

## Purpose of Git Katas

This repository is a collection of Git exercises.

The exercises are designed for use when teaching Git courses. You should be able to use them as self-contained exercises that will allow you to keep your Git skills sharp.

Exercises starting with _basic_ are entry-level - other exercises vary greatly in difficulty.

To get an overview of the exercises in here look in [Overview.md](Overview.md).

New exercises will be added and posted to channel #git in the Think Company Slack.

## Provenance of this code

The concept was taken from [Schauderhaft.de](http://blog.schauderhaft.de/gitkata/).

Individual exercise are ported from [Praqma](https://www.praqma.com/)'s  [training repository](https://github.com/praqma-training/git-katas), and have been ported to Node for use at Think.  Our plan is to contribute improvements back to the source repository.

## Contributing
